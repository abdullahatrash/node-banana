## [Unreleased]

### Relaunch — agent-first BYOK content pipeline

Node Banana is repositioned from an early image-generation tool into one
product: **the BYOK content pipeline your agents plug into** — a visual content
workflow editor, an agent/scale layer (CLI + MCP), and a durable social
publishing hub, over a single engine. PRs #118–#135.

#### Added — agent surface

- **Workspace-scoped API tokens** — Bearer `nb_` tokens stored only as a SHA-256
  hash with a non-secret display prefix; shown once; created/revoked in workspace
  settings. (#123)
- **Public REST API v1** (`/api/v1/*`) re-exposing workspaces, runs, assets, and
  social posting through the existing authorization layer, workspace-scoped. (#131, #132, #134)
- **Tool registry** (`src/lib/agent-tools/registry.ts`) — one Zod-typed set of
  tool definitions that powers all agent surfaces, plus a **hosted MCP server**
  over streamable HTTP at `/api/mcp`. (#126)
- **`nb` CLI** (`packages/cli`, added as a pnpm workspace) mirroring the tools:
  `auth`, `workspaces`, `accounts`, `assets`, `run`, `post` — each with `--json`
  for CI. (#129)

#### Added — BYOK-only inference

- **Per-workspace provider-key vault** (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Kie, Fal,
  Replicate, WaveSpeed), encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM. (#125)
- **Key resolution seam** — request header → workspace vault → typed
  `byok_key_missing` error; **no server-env inference fallback on any product
  path.** Chat and quickstart features migrated off the hardcoded server Gemini
  key. (#128, #130)

#### Added — social publishing, alive

- **Cron wiring** in `vercel.json` invoking the internal dispatch, recovery,
  sweep, token-refresh, webhook-delivery, reconcile, automation, digest, and
  cleanup routes on appropriate cadences (1-minute dispatch requires Vercel Pro;
  QStash documented as the self-host fallback). (#119)
- **Platform credential gating** — platforms without configured credentials are
  cleanly hidden/disabled rather than shown broken. (#120)
- **MSW provider contract tests** exercising each provider's real SDK/`fetch`
  against mocked platform HTTP (successful post, token-refresh, rate-limit retry,
  permanent-failure classification); X is verified live end-to-end. (#118, #124)

#### Fixed

- Provider error classification hardened across the social adapters so retry vs.
  refresh-token vs. permanent-failure is decided from real platform errors. (#127)

#### Removed (cuts)

- Desktop-era local-filesystem routes (`browse-directory`, `open-directory`,
  `open-file`, `load-file`) — no arbitrary-filesystem attack surface on the
  hosted product. (#122)
- The community-workflows proxy and dead-pillar navigation stubs — no runtime
  coupling to an external site, no vaporware in the UI. (#121)

#### Changed

- Migrated ESLint to the Next.js flat config. (#133)
- README, `.env.example`, and `CLAUDE.md` rewritten to describe the single
  product identity. (#117)

## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- Adaptive image resolution scaling — swaps full-res images for JPEG thumbnails when nodes are small on screen

### Fixed

- Router/switch passthrough losing data when multiple types (text + image) flow through the same router to one target
- SplitGrid node Split button permanently disabled — sourceImage now updates reactively when an edge is connected
- Node connection handles clipped at edges — removed paint containment that acted like overflow hidden
- Thumbnail cache key collisions causing wrong images on nodes
- Pending thumbnail map not cleaned up on rejection, causing stale entries
- Pointer-events on node images/content blocking pan and drag interactions
- Hover state updates firing during node drag, causing unnecessary re-renders
- Hover events not blocked during mouse-down drag
- backdrop-blur-sm causing poor rendering performance on Windows

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- Ensure auto-routed prompts retain correct individual item text
- Add rounded corners to ImageInput image and InlineParameterPanel settings

### Other

- Increase ArrayNode top padding to match side padding
- Add top padding and max-width to ArrayNode top fields
- Update ArrayNode layout to match new design language

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Router, Switch & ConditionalSwitch Nodes** - Three new flow-control node types with toggle UI, rule editing, dynamic handles, and dimming integration
- **Gemini Veo Video Generation** - Veo 3.1 video models with full parameter support and error handling
- **Anthropic Claude LLM Provider** - Claude models available in LLM node alongside Gemini and OpenAI
- **Floating Node Headers** - Headers rendered via ViewportPortal with drag-to-move, hover controls, and Browse button
- **ControlPanel** - Centralized parameter editing panel with node-type routing and Run/Apply buttons
- **Full-Bleed Node Layouts** - All major nodes converted to edge-to-edge content with overlay controls
- **Inline Parameters** - Toggle to show model parameters directly on nodes with reactive sync
- **Video Autoplay** - useVideoAutoplay hook integrated into all 5 video node types
- **Inline Variable Highlights** - PromptConstructor highlights template variables inline
- **Minimap Navigation** - Click-to-navigate and scroll-to-zoom on minimap
- **Node Dimming System** - CSS-based visual dimming for disabled Switch/ConditionalSwitch paths
- **Unsaved Changes Warning** - Browser warns before closing tab with unsaved workflow
- **All Nodes Menu** - Floating action bar with All Nodes dropdown and All Models button
- **Provider Filter Icons** - ModelSearchDialog filters by available providers

### Fixed

- Ease curve outputDuration passthrough through parent-child connections
- Canvas hover state suppressed during panning to prevent re-render cascading
- Node click-to-select failures caused by d3-drag dead zone
- Aspect-fit resize after manual resize aligns with React Flow dimension priority
- Settings panel seamless selection ring, background matching, and z-index layering
- ConditionalSwitch stale input, handle alignment, and text routing
- Veo negative prompt connectable as text handle, error handling, image validation
- API headers scoped to active provider, temperature falsy bug fixed
- Image flicker on settings toggle, presets popup dismiss, modal overlay click-through
- Node paste height compounding, group label anchoring, file input backdrop issues
- Handle visibility on full-bleed and OutputNode, clipped handle resolution
- FloatingNodeHeader width tracking, right-alignment, and Windows drag interception
- Smart cascade made type-aware so text inputs don't rescue dimmed image paths
- RouterNode auto-resize, handle colors, and placeholder styling

### Changed

- EaseCurveNode, SplitGridNode, Generate3DControls, GenerateVideoControls refactored to full-bleed patterns
- ConditionalSwitch execution logic deduplicated with shared evaluateRule utility
- ModelParameters collapsible toggle removed

### Performance

- Selective Zustand subscriptions replace bare useWorkflowStore() calls
- RAF-debounced setHoveredNodeId and BaseNode ResizeObserver
- Edge rendering optimized for large canvases
- FloatingNodeHeader, InlineParameterPanel, ModelParameters wrapped in React.memo
- useShallow for WorkflowCanvas store subscription
- Narrow selectors for ControlPanel and GroupControlsOverlay

### Tests

- Removed redundant and brittle component tests (-1,958 lines)
- Updated assertions for full-bleed nodes, floating action bar, and Gemini video

### Other

- Added MIT license

- Settings redesigned with pill tabs, segmented controls, and toggles
- Multi-layer box-shadow for smooth settings panel shadow
